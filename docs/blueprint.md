# **App Name**: DiagCode AI

## Core Features:

- Automated Diagnostic Coding: Process clinical documents (images, PDFs, TXT) using OCR and NLP to identify relevant clinical concepts and symptoms. The system will employ an LLM to make a best effort attempt at determining which piece of information in the notes will be the most salient and thus should be included in its recommendation. Note that an external tool might be needed to accomplish this goal.
- Coding System Selection: Allow users to select between CIE-10, CIE-11, and CIE-O coding systems.
- Diagnosis Suggestion: Generate a prioritized list of suggested diagnoses based on the selected coding system (CIE-10, CIE-11, CIE-O).
- Medical Interface: Design a user-friendly medical interface for review, validation, and feedback of diagnoses.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and professionalism.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), almost white, for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00BCD4) to highlight key actions and information. Cyan, being slightly to the 'left' of blue in hue, offers a harmonious contrast that maintains a professional and trustworthy feel, avoiding the visual disruption that a more contrasting hue might introduce.
- Body: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) - modern look and readability for body text. Headlines: 'Playfair' (serif) â€“ provides elegance.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use clear and recognizable medical icons related to diagnoses and coding systems.
- Prioritize a clean, well-organized layout with clear hierarchy and intuitive navigation.
